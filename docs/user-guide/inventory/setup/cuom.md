#Compound Units of Measure

Compound Units are simplified terms given to large quantities. They
are used to create simplified units of measurement of the same quantity. 
It helps in standardizing mathematical operation of	quantities. 
For example:

1 Box can be made a compound unit which consists of 100 piece of items i.e.

**1 Box = 100 pieces**
